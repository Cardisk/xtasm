# ⚙️  XTASM

XTASM is a pure educational project which tries to be more user-friendly than assembly.

The purpose of this project is to have a less complex and higher-level syntax mantaining
some of the low-level features that assembly has.

The last goal of the development is to have a small working language (obviously not that efficient) 
with which you can implement some basic stuff.

## Development Goals

- [ ] Simple syntax that doesn't go against the user
- [ ] Good error reporting during lexing and parsing
- [ ] Native execution (x86 && arm)
- [ ] Both 32 and 64 bit
- [ ] Statically typed
- [ ] Self hosted (last goal)
